# Product Advisor

#### Author: Mario Cuello

This is the source code for a product advisor. It allows users to either proceed via a few guided questions, or via a form. Once completed it shows the relevant product that would best work for your solution according to a formula. It also allows a user to input their email and receive the advised product.
